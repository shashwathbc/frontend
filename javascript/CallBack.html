<!-- where one function has to wait for another function -->
<!-- A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function -->
<!-- A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution. A more 
     formal definition would be - 
     Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed 
     in that other function is called as a callback function. -->
