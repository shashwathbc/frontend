<!-- var let const -->

<!-- var:
var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them 
is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped. 
It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let. -->

<!-- let:  
et allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, 
or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, 
which declares a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope. -->

<!-- const:
ES6 introduced the const keyword, which is used to define a new variable in JavaScript.
 Generally, the var keyword is used to declare a JavaScript variable. Const is another keyword
 to declare a variable when you do not want to change the value of that variable for the whole program. -->

 <!-- declare and inisialize :
Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it.
 Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows. Storing a value in a variable is called 
 variable initialization. You can do variable
 initialization at the time of variable creation or at a later point in time when you need that variable. -->

 <!-- global scope:
In a programming environment, the global scope is the scope that contains,
 and is visible in, all other scopes. In client-side JavaScript,
 the global scope is generally the web page inside which all the code is being executed. -->
