//Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition:
// In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. 
// Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:
// myVar = myVar + 5;
// to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, 
// there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.
// One such operator is the += operator.
// let myVar = 1;
// myVar += 5;
// console.log(myVar);
// 6 would be displayed in the console.

let b = 17;
let c = 12;

//Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
